## Comments ##

1. Assignment3_prt_1_2.py completes the tasks for 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. Results are stored in 2_1_asnwer.txt
2. Assignment3_prt_3.py completes backup and restore for task 3.1 The backup and restore rely on bson files for each collection. Output is stored in 2_2_asnwer.txt and the graph is 2_2_bar_graph.pdf
3. For task 2.3 I did not get the tweepy api working early enough in the week to have a meaningful pre_post but I manipulated the amounts using .limit to show my method for comparing the two collections works. the 2_3_asnwer.txt file shows the results of my comparison algorithm
